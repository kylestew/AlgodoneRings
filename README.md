Algodone Rings:
This algorithm is inspired by the Algodones dune field in Southern California. It's always the most interesting part of my drive home to Arizona. Though the underlying structure is always the same, the dunes are constantly changing in subtle and unique ways due to the randomness in the environment. In this piece multiple rings are created with the same starting conditions. Random forces and time work together to evolve each ring into a unique structure. Although they may start the same, no two rings will ever end up alike.

Materials: Electrons, Python, any computer that can run Python, code heavily influenced by Inconvergent
